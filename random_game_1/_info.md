#### This is a game, first I wanted to make a space-invader-like game but it changed a bit to a defend-a-spaceship-by-shooting-meteors-like game.
##### This needs pygame to work, do `pip install pygame` before starting it.
###### This is written in python 3.

#### Disclaimer:
    This needs python 3.6 due to f-strings being used.
